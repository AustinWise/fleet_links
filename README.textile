h1. WARNING

Just in case you didn't notice, this version (the zend framework one) is not complete.
Not that it really matters, as this whole program is pretty useless since the fleet finder was
added to EVE.

h1. Fleet Links

In EVE Online, forming up large fleets and keeping up with requests to join existing fleets has always been a chore.  The Trinity 1.1 patch helped by adding the ability to post a links in chat channels that let anyone in the alliance join.  Fleet Links takes these links and stores them in a website so your alliance mates merely have to open the in-game browser (IGB) to get into fleet.

h2. Installation

Fleet Links is tested to work with both IIS7, Apache, and lighttpd.  You will need PHP installed on your web/app server.  Use @database.sql@ to create the tables in your MySQL server.

h3. Special Insturctions for IIS7

You will also need the "URL Rewrite Module for IIS 7":http://blogs.iis.net/ruslany/archive/2009/04/20/url-rewrite-module-1-1-for-iis-7.aspx .

h2. Limitations

The site assumes anyone using it is in an alliance.  Any fleet added by someone in a non-alliance corporation gets grouped in the "None" alliance.

h2. Security

While the site does prevent players from deleting other alliance's fleets, this provides minimal protection.

h2. Ideas for more features

* Stronger security and logging
* Integration with op-tracking systems
