In EVE Online, forming up large fleets and keeping up with requests to join
existing fleets has always been a chore.  The Trinity 1.1 patch helped by adding
the ability to post a links in chat channels that let anyone in the alliance
join.  Fleet Links takes these links and stores them in a website so your
alliance mates merely have to open the in-game browser (IGB) to get into fleet.

Installation

You need a web server with PHP and a database server running MySql.  Use
database.sql to create the tables and put your database connection information
into config.php.

Limitations

The site assumes anyone using it is in an alliance.  Any fleet added by someone
in a non-alliance corporation gets grouped in the "None" alliance.

Security

While the site does prevent players from deleting other alliance's fleets, this
provides minimal protection.

Ideas for more features
* Stronger security and logging
* Integration with op-tracking systems
